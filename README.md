Certainly! Below is an expanded version of the IoT-Based Plant Monitoring System project that includes a detailed circuit diagram and descriptions for each component.

Project Title: IoT-Based Plant Monitoring System

Project Overview

The IoT-based Plant Monitoring System allows users to remotely monitor the health of their plants by measuring soil moisture, temperature, and light levels. The system sends alerts through a mobile application when the plant needs watering or when environmental conditions change.

Features

Monitor soil moisture, temperature, and light intensity.

Send real-time notifications to users when the plant needs watering or when environmental conditions change.

User-friendly mobile app interface for monitoring.

Data logging for historical analysis.

Components Required

1. Microcontroller: ESP8266 or ESP32 (for Wi-Fi connectivity)


2. Sensors:

Soil Moisture Sensor (capacitive or resistive)

DHT11 or DHT22 (Temperature and Humidity Sensor)

LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) or BH1750 (Light Sensor)



3. Breadboard and Jumper Wires


4. Power Supply: Battery or USB power supply


5. Mobile App/ Web Interface: Optional (could use Blynk or create a custom app)


6. Resistors: 10kΩ resistor for LDR and 220Ω resistor for LEDs, if used for indication.


7. LEDs: For visual notifications (optional).

                +--------------------+

Description of Connections

Soil Moisture Sensor: Connect the sensor’s signal pin to A0 on the ESP8266, VCC to 3.3V, and GND to GND.

DHT11/DHT22: Connect the data pin to D2 on the ESP8266, VCC to 3.3V, and GND to GND.

LDR: Connect one terminal of the LDR to A1 on the ESP8266, the other terminal to GND. Use a pull-up resistor (10kΩ) connected between the A1 pin and 3.3V to create a voltage divider circuit.


Code Example

Here’s a basic example of code to read data from the sensors and send it to the Blynk app:

#include <ESP8266WiFi.h>
#include <BlynkSimpleEsp8266.h>
#include <DHT.h>

#define DHTPIN 2           // DHT11 pin
#define DHTTYPE DHT11      // DHT 11
#define SOIL_MOISTURE_PIN A0  // Soil moisture sensor pin
#define LDR_PIN A1          // Light sensor pin

DHT dht(DHTPIN, DHTTYPE);
char auth[] = "YourBlynkAuthToken"; // Blynk authentication token
char ssid[] = "YourSSID"; // Wi-Fi SSID
char pass[] = "YourPassword"; // Wi-Fi password

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200);
  Blynk.begin(auth, ssid, pass);
  dht.begin();
}

void loop() {
  Blynk.run();

  // Read temperature and humidity
  float h = dht.readHumidity();
  float t = dht.readTemperature();

  // Read soil moisture
  int soilMoisture = analogRead(SOIL_MOISTURE_PIN);

  // Read light level
  int lightLevel = analogRead(LDR_PIN);

  // Send data to Blynk
  Blynk.virtualWrite(V0, h); // Humidity
  Blynk.virtualWrite(V1, t); // Temperature
  Blynk.virtualWrite(V2, soilMoisture); // Soil moisture
  Blynk.virtualWrite(V3, lightLevel); // Light level

  // Add a delay for better stability
  delay(2000);
}

Setup Instructions

1. Hardware Setup:

Connect the components according to the circuit diagram.

Make sure the power supply is connected properly to the ESP8266.



2. Software Setup:

Install the Arduino IDE and required libraries (Blynk, DHT).

Create a new project in the Blynk aESP8266 boards.

Blynk Project: Create a project in the Blynk app, add value display widgets, and link them to virtual pins V0 to V3.

Code Setup: Replace Wi-Fi credentials and Blynk authentication token in the code.



3. Blynk App Setup:

Create a new project and add widgets for each sensor reading.

Set virtual pins in the app to match those in the code.
